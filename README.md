# INDEPENDENT_PROJECT_ON_SUPERVISED_LEARNING_WITH_EXPLORATORY_DATA_ANALYSIS_MCHEZO_PESA_PROJECT.

## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING 
 Mchezo pesa is a football analyst company in East Africa. Mchezo-Pesa would like to predict the result of a game based whether the teams playing are in their home country or not and whether the game is friendly or not.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

## METRIC FOR SUCCESS 
This project will be successful when:

1) We accurately predict the winning team based on the two factors:

       a)Home team or away team
      
       b)The type of tournament 

2) The model achieves atleast 80% accuracy

3) Have the lowest RMSE score possible

### d) Experimental Design
The project was undertaken using the following design
Datasets(Fifa-ranking.csv + results.csv)

* Merging datasets

* Performing EDA

* Feature Engineering

* Polynomial Regression

* Logistic regression

* Computing the RMSE

* Plotting residual plots

* Assessing their heteroscedasticity using Barlette's test

* Challenging the solution

* Conclusion

## Conclusion
Polynomial Regression and Logistic Regression did yield an accurate model to predict the FIFA outcomes since there RMSE scores were quite low hence high predictive capability.
